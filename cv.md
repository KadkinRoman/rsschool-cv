## __About Me__
I have experience in commercial development in C++ and C##.  
Now I want to become a web developer, so I began to actively study website development technologies.  
I learned the basics of java script, html and sss. Also created some simple websites.  
My task is to improve the skills of creating websites and achieve high results.
